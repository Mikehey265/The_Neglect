# The_Neglect
This game was developed over 7 weeks by 12 first-year Futuregames students from Warsaw and Malm√∂. The Neglect is a first person psychological horror experience inspired by the tragic real-life case of Lacey Fletcher. Immerse yourself in a chilling environment, solve puzzles and unravel a haunting story to escape the nightmare.
