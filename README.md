# The_Neglect
This game was developed over 7 weeks by 12 first-year Futuregames students from Warsaw and Malmö. The Neglect is a first person psychological horror experience inspired by the tragic real-life case of Lacey Fletcher. Immerse yourself in a chilling environment, solve puzzles and unravel a haunting story to escape the nightmare.

## General info
This game was our first project in Unreal Engine 5. Since we had little to no experience with this engine, our team decided to keep the scope small. The entire game takes place in a single location, introducing the player to loops that have them traverse the same corridor or room repeatedly. To keep things engaging, we ensured that each loop is unique in some way. New puzzles, hints, or items are just a few examples of this. The player gradually learns more about the house with each loop, and it’s entirely up to them to break free or remain trapped forever.

## Controls
* WSAD - move forward, backwards, left and right
* F - flashlight ON/OFF
* LMB - interact with items
* RMB - zoom in the camera
* Scroll wheel - switch between items

## My contribution
This being my (and the other programmers) first project in this engine, I was responsible for almost everything - character movement, triggers, UI - each of us contributed a bit of something. We used this project as a learning opportunity to explore different aspects of game development. That said, I believe my biggest contributions were the player controller and UI, though I also worked on smaller, yet equally important, tasks.

## Development cycle
Once we had the game concept and all the references in place, we began with a simple level blockout and our one and only enemy model. The level was heavily inspired by 'P.T.' We quickly decided that every model in the game would have three phases, each becoming progressively bloodier than the last. <br>

Later, we added the initial materials, lighting, and loops. The player controller was functioning well, and just before the alpha build, the player could walk around, open doors, and pick up items. We also introduced the first version of the player’s body model. Essentially, for the alpha build, we had a basic walking simulator.<br>

Over time, we had more and more assets ready to place in the level. The level itself received updated lighting, materials, and everything was coming together. The UI was complete, and our 'mother' model was in the final stages of polishing. Triggers were placed where they needed to be, jump scares were set, and just like that, after seven weeks, we had a fully functioning game.
